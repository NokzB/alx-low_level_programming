This is my first experience using variables, if statements, else statements and while loops
Task zero prints the number in a variable as positive or negative
task one prints the last number stored in n
Task two prints lowercase alphabets followed by a new line
task three prints lowe and uppercase alphabets followed by a new line
task four prints all alphabets except for q and e
task five prints the single digits of base 10 starting from zero
task six is the same as task five but uses int instead if char
task seven prints lowercase alphabets in reverse
task eight prints all numbers of base 16 in lowercase (numbers 0 - 9 and alphabet)
task nine prints all possible combinations of single digit numbers.
